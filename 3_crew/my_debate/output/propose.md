The argument in favor of the motion that AI is a better teacher than human teachers revolves around several compelling factors. Firstly, AI offers personalized learning experiences that can adapt to the individual needs of students. Unlike human teachers, AI systems can analyze vast amounts of data to identify a student's strengths, weaknesses, and preferred learning styles, enabling tailored educational pathways that maximize student potential.

Secondly, AI can provide immediate feedback and support. Students can receive instant clarification and assistance at any hour of the day, which fosters a more engaging and self-paced learning environment. This availability ensures that learning is not confined to classroom hours, allowing students to study when they feel most productive.

Moreover, AI can consistently deliver content without the biases, fatigue, or emotional variability that human teachers may experience. This objectivity helps maintain a level of uniformity in teaching quality across different educational settings. Additionally, AI can scale its teaching capabilities to reach an unlimited number of students simultaneously, providing resources and support to underserved communities where qualified human teachers may be scarce.

Lastly, with endless access to the latest educational resources and developments, AI can continually update its teaching methodologies. This keeps the learning process relevant and aligned with contemporary knowledge and skills necessary for a rapidly changing world.

In conclusion, AI's ability to personalize education, provide reliable support, maintain objectivity, scale to a broader audience, and continuously adapt to educational advancements makes it a superior teaching tool compared to traditional human educators. Hence, the motion that AI is a better teacher than human teachers stands strong based on its enhanced capability to support and elevate the learning experience for all students.
